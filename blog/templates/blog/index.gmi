# hamster.dance gemlog

I write these articles on Markdown and publish them on my web site, which then also converts them to Gemtext through a custom-coded process. You may find that there are a lot of links that lead from these articles to non-Gemini protocols.

{% for article in articles %}=>./gemlog.py?article={{ article.slug }} {{ article.published|date:"Y-m-d" }}: {{ article.title }}
{% endfor %}
